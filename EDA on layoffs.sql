-- ======================================================

-- üîç Identify potential duplicates
SELECT company, location, industry, total_laid_off, date, COUNT(*) AS dup_count
FROM layoffs1
GROUP BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off, date
HAVING dup_count > 1;

-- ‚úÖ (Optional) Add unique ID if not present
-- ALTER TABLE world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
-- ADD COLUMN id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT;

-- üóëÔ∏è Delete duplicates but keep one copy
DELETE FROM layoffs1
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id FROM (
    SELECT id,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
             PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off, date
             ORDER BY id
           ) AS rn
    FROM layoffs1

);

-- ‚úÖ Verify duplicates removed
SELECT company, location, industry, total_laid_off, date, COUNT(*) AS dup_count
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off, date
HAVING dup_count > 1;

SELECT MAX(total_laid_off) AS max_laid_off
FROM layoffs1;

-- üìà Max & Min layoff percentage
SELECT MAX(percentage_laid_off) AS max_pct, MIN(percentage_laid_off) AS min_pct

-- üè≠ 3. AGGREGATION & GROUP-BY ANALYSIS
-- ======================================================

-- Top 5 biggest single layoffs
SELECT company, total_laid_off
FROM layoffs1
ORDER BY total_laid_off DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Companies with the most total layoffs
SELECT company, SUM(total_laid_off) AS total
FROM layoffs1
GROUP BY company
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Layoffs by location
SELECT location, SUM(total_laid_off) AS total
FROM layoffs1
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Layoffs by country
SELECT country, SUM(total_laid_off) AS total
FROM layoffs1
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY total DESC;

-- Layoffs by year
SELECT YEAR(date) AS years, SUM(total_laid_off) AS total
FROM layoffs1
GROUP BY YEAR(date)
ORDER BY years ASC;

-- Layoffs by industry
SELECT industry, SUM(total_laid_off) AS total
FROM layoffs1
GROUP BY industry
ORDER BY total DESC;

-- Layoffs by stage
SELECT stage, SUM(total_laid_off) AS total
FROM layoffs1
GROUP BY stage
ORDER BY total DESC;

-- ======================================================

-- üèÜ Top 3 companies per year by layoffs
